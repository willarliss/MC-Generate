# Markov-Chain Corpus/Generator

Create a language graph from a set of documents. The graph is constructed by treating each document as a markov chain. Functionality for document classification, clustering, and generation is explored. See [`testing.ipynb`](testing.ipynb) for examples of classification, generation, and clustering capabilities. See [`testing2.ipynb`](testing2.ipynb) for an example of oversampling to improve imbalanced classification performance.
